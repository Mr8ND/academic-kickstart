# About
I am third year PhD student in the department of Statistics & Data Science at Carnegie Mellon University. My primary research interests are statistical machine learning methodologies driven by real world problems, mainly from the natural sciences. I am also interested in high dimensional non-parametrics and model validation techniques.

Prior to CMU, I have worked for a couple of years in London as Analyst for Zynga (NaturalMotion) after pursuing an M.Sc. in Statistics at Imperial College London, where I have worked on bayesian hierarchical models for cosmology under the guidance of Dr. Daniel Mortlock. Before that, everything started with a B.Sc. in Mathematics and a Diploma in Government and Natural Sciences from University of Turin, Italy.
