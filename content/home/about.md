# About
I am a fourth year PhD student in the department of Statistics & Data Science at Carnegie Mellon University. My primary research interests are statistical machine learning methodologies driven by real world problems and complex datasets, especially from the natural sciences. I am very fortunate to be advised by professor [Ann B. Lee](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~annlee/). I am a member of the Statistical Methods for the Physical Sciences ([STAMPS](http://stat.cmu.edu/stamps/)) and I also collaborate with professor [Alessandro Rinaldo](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~arinaldo/) and Dr. [Robin Mejia](https://www.cmu.edu/chrs/people-partners/mejia.html).

Prior to CMU, I have worked for a couple of years in London as Analyst for Zynga (NaturalMotion) after pursuing an M.Sc. in Statistics at Imperial College London, where I have worked on bayesian hierarchical models for cosmology under the guidance of Dr. [Daniel Mortlock](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/d.mortlock) and Dr. [Stephen Feeney](http://zuserver2.star.ucl.ac.uk/~smf/). Before that, everything started with a B.Sc. in Mathematics and a Diploma in Government and Natural Sciences from University of Turin, Italy.
