# About
AI Research Lead at [J.P.Morgan AI Research](https://www.jpmorgan.com/technology/artificial-intelligence) with a Ph.D. in Statistics from Carnegie Mellon University, where I was fortunate to be advised by professor [Ann B. Lee](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~annlee/).  I develop and implement innovative AI solutions in finance, focusing on statistical machine learning, uncertainty quantification, and algorithmic fairness, which I actively publish at AI conferences. My research interests lie in deep generative models, time series analysis, temporal point processes, stochastic optimization and large language models.

Prior to CMU, I have worked for a couple of years in London as Analyst for Zynga (NaturalMotion) after pursuing an M.Sc. in Statistics at Imperial College London, where I have worked on Bayesian hierarchical models for cosmology under the guidance of Dr. [Daniel Mortlock](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/d.mortlock) and Dr. [Stephen Feeney](http://zuserver2.star.ucl.ac.uk/~smf/). Before that, everything started with a B.Sc. in Mathematics and a Diploma in Government and Natural Sciences from University of Turin, Italy.
